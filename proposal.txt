W2P (When & What to Plant)
AI for Agriculture | BeOrchid Africa Developers Hackathon 2026
Executive Summary
W2P is an AI-powered agricultural intelligence platform built to remove uncertainty from planting
decisions. It combines climate forecasting, machine learning, and localized environmental data to
guide farmers on when to plant, what to plant, and the level of yield risk they face. The system
transforms raw climate data into practical, actionable guidance for African smallholder farmers.
Problem Statement
Growing up on a farm, planting season always felt like a gamble. Before planting, the first concern
was whether the seeds would germinate. We questioned soil moisture levels, rainfall stability,
temperature, and humidity. Planting requires financial commitment in clearing land, plowing,
purchasing seeds, and labor. If germination fails, those investments are lost. Even when crops
germinate, farmers remain uncertain whether weather conditions will sustain growth through
flowering and seed production. Across Africa, traditional planting calendars no longer align with
shifting climate patterns. The challenge is not lack of effort but lack of accessible, localized climate
intelligence.
Proposed Solution
W2P analyzes historical rainfall trends, seasonal forecasts, temperature patterns, and soil inputs to
predict optimal planting windows. Using time-series forecasting models such as Prophet or LSTM,
the system estimates rainfall onset stability and growing season reliability. Machine learning
classifiers such as Random Forest or XGBoost evaluate crop suitability and generate germination
probability scores and yield risk estimates. Farmers receive clear recommendations tailored to their
location, helping them reduce financial risk and improve productivity.
Technical Architecture
Backend: FastAPI built in Python with PostgreSQL for structured climate and crop data storage.
The system is containerized using Docker for portability and cloud deployment readiness.
Machine Learning Layer: Time-series forecasting for rainfall prediction, supervised learning models
for crop suitability classification, feature engineering based on rainfall averages, temperature
variability, and seasonal indices.
Frontend: React-based interface designed to be mobile-first and low-bandwidth compatible. The
interface provides planting recommendations, risk visualization dashboards, and yield projection
summaries.
Scalability and Impact
W2P is designed as a scalable cloud-ready platform that can serve individual farmers,
cooperatives, and government advisory bodies. The architecture supports expansion to multiple
regions and crop types. Future integration can include SMS advisory systems, satellite vegetation
indices, and insurance risk modeling.
