Summary
 
W2P
 
is
 
an
 
AI-powered
 
agricultural
 
intelligence
 
platform
 
built
 
to
 
remove
 
uncertainty
 
from
 
planting
 
decisions.
 
Growing
 
up
 
on
 
a
 
farm,
 
planting
 
season
 
always
 
felt
 
like
 
a
 
gamble.
 
Before
 
planting,
 
we
 
worried
 
whether
 
the
 
seeds
 
would
 
germinate,
 
whether
 
rainfall
 
had
 
truly
 
stabilized,
 
and
 
whether
 
temperature
 
and
 
soil
 
moisture
 
conditions
 
were
 
right.
 
Planting
 
requires
 
real
 
financial
 
commitment
 
in
 
clearing
 
land,
 
plowing,
 
purchasing
 
seeds,
 
and
 
labor.
 
If
 
germination
 
fails,
 
that
 
money
 
is
 
lost.
 
Even
 
when
 
crops
 
germinate,
 
farmers
 
remain
 
uncertain
 
whether
 
seasonal
 
weather
 
conditions
 
will
 
sustain
 
growth
 
through
 
flowering
 
and
 
seed
 
production.
 
 
W2P
 
transforms
 
climate
 
data
 
into
 
practical,
 
localized
 
planting
 
guidance
 
so
 
farmers
 
can
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions
 
about
 
when
 
to
 
plant
 
and
 
what
 
to
 
plant.
 
 
Problem
 
Statement
 
Across
 
Africa,
 
smallholder
 
farmers
 
depend
 
heavily
 
on
 
seasonal
 
rainfall
 
and
 
climate
 
stability.
 
Traditional
 
planting
 
calendars
 
are
 
increasingly
 
unreliable
 
due
 
to
 
shifting
 
climate
 
patterns.
 
Farmers
 
often
 
make
 
planting
 
decisions
 
based
 
on
 
experience
 
and
 
intuition
 
rather
 
than
 
predictive
 
data.
 
This
 
results
 
in:
 
●
 
Failed
 
germination
 
due
 
to
 
unstable
 
rainfall
 
onset
 
●
 
Reduced
 
yield
 
because
 
of
 
mid-season
 
drought
 
or
 
temperature
 
spikes
 
●
 
Financial
 
loss
 
from
 
wasted
 
seeds,
 
labor,
 
and
 
land
 
preparation
 
●
 
Increased
 
food
 
insecurity
 
The
 
core
 
problem
 
is
 
not
 
lack
 
of
 
effort
 
or
 
knowledge.
 
The
 
problem
 
is
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
accessible,
 
localized
 
climate
 
intelligence
 
that
 
translates
 
environmental
 
data
 
into
 
actionable
 
decisions
 
for
 
farmers.
 
 
Proposed
 
Solution
 
W2P
 
analyzes
 
historical
 
rainfall
 
trends,
 
seasonal
 
forecasts,
 
temperature
 
patterns,
 
and
 
soil
 
inputs
 
to
 
predict
 
optimal
 
planting
 
windows
 
and
 
crop
 
suitability
 
for
 
specific
 
regions.
 
The
 
system
 
uses:
 
●
 
Time-series
 
forecasting
 
models,
 
LSTM
 
to
 
predict
 
rainfall
 
onset
 
stability
 
and
 
seasonal
 
consistency
 
●
 
Supervised
 
machine
 
learning
 
models,
 
Random
 
Forest
 
to
 
evaluate
 
crop
 
suitability
 
●
 
Risk
 
scoring
 
algorithms
 
to
 
estimate
 
germination
 
probability
 
and
 
end-of-season
 
yield
 
risk
 
 
Farmers
 
or
 
cooperatives
 
input
 
their
 
location
 
and
 
basic
 
farm
 
parameters.
 
W2P
 
outputs:
 
1.
 
Recommended
 
planting
 
window
 
2.
 
Most
 
suitable
 
crop
 
among
 
selected
 
regional
 
options
 
3.
 
Germination
 
probability
 
score
 
4.
 
Yield
 
risk
 
estimate
 
This
 
helps
 
farmers
 
reduce
 
financial
 
risk
 
before
 
committing
 
resources.
